## 📁 File Structure

Problem-1: Create a small calculator which performs operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using class.
  Calculator inputs :> ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘type of operation’
  Datatype :> ‘a’ = double, ‘b’ = double, ‘type of operation’ = string
 
 
Problem-2: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1, 3
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7
    .
    .
    5) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, .......
 
 
Problem-3: With a single integer as the input, generate the following until a = x [series of numbers as shown in below examples]
 
  Output: (examples)
    1) input a = 1, then output : 1
    2) input a = 2, then output : 1
    3) input a = 3, then output : 1, 3, 5
    4) input a = 4, then output : 1, 3, 5
    5) input a = 5, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    6) input a = 6, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    .
    .
    7) input a = x, then output : 1, 3, 5, 7, .......
 
 
Problem-4: Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  (examples)
  input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
  Output: 
    {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
